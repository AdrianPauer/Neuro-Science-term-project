## Distance-Dependent Neural Network Modeling

**Goal:** Model cortical neuron connectivity using distance-dependent network models based on relevant literature.

**Models implemented:**
1. Keiser–Hilbert algorithm for network generation  
2. Improved distance-dependent algorithm  
3. Preferential attachment–based model  

**Evaluation:** Compared simulated networks with real mouse cortex connectivity data.
